# Wires #

This is a simplistic spiderman-physics game based off of
[Double Wires](http://www.freewebarcade.com/game/double-wires/).
That game is definitely better, so probably play that instead.

Anyways, build this somehow, and tell us how you like it!

## Build ##

1. Make sure you have SDL installed (`$ brew install sdl2` on MacOS)
2. Make sure you have SDL_image installed (`$ brew install sdl2_image` on MacOS)
3. Make sure you have other SDL_* i havent mentioned that might happen (check compile errors...)
3. `$ stack build` Will build the executable and put it in a folder specified by the output
4. /that/exe/output/folder/wires-exe should get it working...

If that does not work, then I need to fix the build, because it should be _that_ simple.
